nes is an in-progress emulator for the 6502-based Nintendo Entertainment System.

This project is primarily a personal exploration of the Ada programming
language. Ada is an interesting language at first glance. I'm curious how
ergonomic it is in practice for a small-to-medium complexity project with a
well-defined scope. Beyond that, I just think emulators are neat.

SDL3 is used for window handling and other OS interactions, so it must be
installed somewhere visible to pkg-config. Ada bindings for SDL3 are added
manually as needed.

The build is handled by gprbuild (wrapped with a minimal Makefile). I would
prefer to not use a dedicated build system, but I ran into various issues trying
to use gnatmake or gcc directly. I'll look into this more at some point.

I've been running this on Linux and macOS so far without real issues (SDL3 via
Ada does not seem to respect dark mode on macOS for some reason, though a
seemingly equivalent C++ program works as expected). I'll try Windows at some
point too, if I feel up to using Windows 11.
